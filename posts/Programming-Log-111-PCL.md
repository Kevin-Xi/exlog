Mistakes:
p108 table10-2 row2 column2
p114 table11-1 row3 column3
p117 footnote2 line4

`EVERY` = All

`SOME` = Exist

`NOTANY` = None

`NOTEVERY` = Exist Not

Should I do:

	(defvar a #(1 2 3 4 5))
	(defun foo (x) (* 2 x))
	(map-into a #'foo a')

in Lisp to complete:

	[elem*2 for elem in a]

in Python?

What is the `map` and `reduce` in python**?**

p123, about list, how to comprehend? p125 has explaination.

till section12.3

To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **328 hours**.
