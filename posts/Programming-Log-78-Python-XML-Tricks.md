I finished reading chapter 10 of *Dive into Python*. Before reading, I found the example code are magic; after learning with it, I found the example is practical and graceful, the most important, useful. It's a rejoice learning experience.

To sum up, I spent **1 hours** on programming today, and totally **216 hours**.
