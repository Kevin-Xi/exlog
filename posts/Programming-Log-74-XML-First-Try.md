Since now I understand the XML DTD, I wonder the "kgp.dtd" used in the *Dive into Python*, why should *p*? Is there a reason of well-design or something?

The rule "space count element" make XML like markdown or something. This make me should adjust indecent to control the format of the result. Why they design thing like this?

I wrote an xml doc about Hexagram according kgp.py, it works.

My problems today is why kgp.py know I want a liuhuagua? I should read the kgp.py.

To sum up, I spent **1 hours** on programming today, and totally **207 hours**.
