I finished chapter 9 today. XML processing for now seems to be clear and easy. But I'm still lack of XML knowledge, so I'll borrow some handbook tomorrow or go for w3school maybe.

I read a report today which statistics the dirty words in the commits on github. It shows that python is really low and C++ is quick high. LOL!

To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **204 hours**.
