Today morning I skipped class to learning C# by reading *Microsoft C# 2010: Step by Step*. I read first 6 chapters of it, and found nothing significant.

Afternoon I coded a little toy by C# can access MS SQL using *SQLConnection* kind of stuff. The *SQLComment.Parameters* can natively prevent SQL injection.

After the physics experiment (with quite a lot block of data wait to be processed), I try to learning *Python Scientific lecture notes*, I made chapter 2 section 5. But my *quick_sort.py* can't run, and I remember someone use lambda expression just one line to complete the mission.

To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **219 hours**.
