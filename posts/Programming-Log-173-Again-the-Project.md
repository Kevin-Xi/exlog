Lan ask me to join him with C (yes, the same guy appear in the post "Launching A New Project" before). And we discuss the idea according the new Rassiberry Pi that C buy.

C want to use it to record his life in some form but I'd like to make something both interesting and useful.

To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **548 hours**.
