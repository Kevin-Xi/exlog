I'm stuck in the old pit again. That is if I go to class, I feel the teacher is so inefficience, and begin to self-studing but can't set down because of the chaos. If I go to library to read, WHY I GIVE MONEY TO THEM**?**

To sum up, I spent **1 hours** on programming today, and totally **504 hours**.
