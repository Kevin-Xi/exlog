use make fail to install

use make-dpkg successful to get deb, and install

crash when boot with new kernel

use EasyBCD to try adding grub2 boot, successfully booting by old kernel

and successfully booting by new kernel, YEAH~

Actually I don't know how to fix it, I just follow my nose. But like Holmes know where Waston from at the first sight, I also have trails to follow behide my intuition. I have some gift, I want to work hard to discover it. Most people is too lazy to battle with their gift.

Question:
+ Who decide the OS bits**?**
+ What differences between the first and second way to install**?**

To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **661 hours**.
