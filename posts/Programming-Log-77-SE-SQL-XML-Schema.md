I went through 3 chapters of our SE textbook morning. Questions:

+ Waterfall Model? (p19)
+ The difference between sequence chart, status chart, activity chart? (p63-65)

I checked my answer of SQL assignment. The differences:

+ He use where clause, I use inner join.
+ He use single table, I use inner join (like Q5), this time his is more clear.
+ He don't use case when ... then in update but where.
+ insert into vs select ... into

Which one is more efficiency?

Hard: Q6, Q18, Q23 has trick

Q6 can think in this way: A contains B. First figure out what A and B represent, and then write B(usually not relative with before), finally write A(which ID equals previous A.ID).

Q18: The trick is how to convert real request.

Before sleep I do some python. Questions:

+ What 

		self.capitalizeNextWord

for in *parse_Text*?

Answers:

+ For upcase the first letter of a sentence. The attr of p will tag this value.

To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **215 hours**.
