need take notes: p106, p109 footnote, p112-113, p114-116, ...

mistake: p108 table10-2, p117 footnote

* Ontogeny-recapitulates-phylogency* is funny

+ Why `sort` and `stable-sort` as a "destructive" function still need to be `setf`**?**

Chapter 11 really has too many to remember.

+ In slime you cannot access a var without `*` surround it to indicate it is a dynamic var. Why**?**

To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **322 hours**.
