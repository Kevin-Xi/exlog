I got an idea now. I'm trying to analyse every *yao* of a *gua* by its position(with rules *dangwei*, *dezhong*, *cheng or cheng*, *ying*), to see if it relative to the judgement on luck or not of *yaoci*.

I wrote a suit of tools to process a raw document of *Yi*. The coding problem is definitly not cool:( But I think I play with python better.

To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **226 hours**.
