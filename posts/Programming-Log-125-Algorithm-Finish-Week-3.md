I found myself kind of algorithm-analyse-holic now. It quite painful at first but happy now.

Lots of desires affect us. Some of them just disappear when time pass by, such as the desire of things popular among your classmates like yo-yo, cards, basketball. But some of them never ever fade (at least last a long period of time). For me, the desire of "Eureka Time", the desire of quiet, the desire to be a pitcher last long.

I think the first kind of desire is but noise, it disturb the owner's mind. But the second kind, desert to be treated as friends, because it exactly what you want to do.

Algorithm, math, computer, network are just magic to me. No one not wonder and desire to uncover the secret of magic show, cause it's just kind of intuition of human. The desire of understand and use the magic of computer is also an intuition of me. To get it is just cool.


I have wondered a long time when I learn the *Analects of Confucius* comes: *It is kind of gentleman if you don't get angry when somebody else don't know you well.* It leave me a mystery cause I have difficult to understand why a person need to be angry if others don't **understand** him. I have little life experience that time. But now I really got angry when some people call me "xueba". Now I understand this aphorism, and I seem to be come over it. I should treat that "suck book (I considered that way when I was young)" more objective.

To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **368 hours**.
