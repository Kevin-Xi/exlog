I design a Web page and think it is good enough. I use photoshop to draw some "MiZiGe" to write character inside it, and png semi-transparent glass. But png is not good in IE (from *CSS Zen Garden*).

But our database mini-semester project is failed. Our leader which
 response for backend think Asp.net MVC is too hard... other two do nothing... I don't want to say too much, and we have to hand out our last project which is write in python.
 
To sum up, I spent **7 hours** on programming today, and totally **503 hours**.
