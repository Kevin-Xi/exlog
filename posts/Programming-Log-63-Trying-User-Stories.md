Today I wrote some user stories and correspond tasks, and making a burn-up chart. I have no experience to decide story points and which to do in next iteration. I can only depend on that a few knowledge I get from *The Art of Agile Development*. Cheers up!

To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **184 hours**.
