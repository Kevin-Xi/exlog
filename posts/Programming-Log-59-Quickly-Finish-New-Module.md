Today I wrote a new module named *sells*, since it very similar to the *tasks* module I 've wrote before, I finished it in a short time.

About the *accounts* module I mentioned yesterday, I will also add bonus system into it. And maybe use *Validation* in the forms.

Recently, our [IT Innovation teacher](http://www.linjun.net.cn/kjcx2013) recommanded an artical named [*Programmer, Establish Your Commerical Awakeness*](http://blog.donews.com/yanhui/archive/2006/03/09/760873.aspx) by Yan Hui. And I also found [Wang Yin's blog](http://www.yinwang.org/) is interesting. I also want to read *Hackers and Painters* and *Hackers* as well. What a greedy!

To sum up, I spent **1 hours** on programming today, and totally **175 hours**.
