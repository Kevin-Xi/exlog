Today I write a prototype of that you can "hear your code", I call it *Codiano*, that is combination of *coding* and *piano*.

Now I use *winsound.beep*, *threading* to do that. That's not good. I will:

+ make a map from keyboard to sound(indiviual .ogg files maybe)
+ think about multithreading

And I found many lib don't support win64.

I'm wondering what kind of people can count as a "good programmer"? You need to "skillful" on a language. But what is "skillful"? Recite all library is not necessary. Maybe follow the philosophy does. And how about platform? Windows or Linux? Should satisfied with wrapped package other wrote or detect by yourself? But I think a "good programmer" should be like code smoothly and happily whatever he/she want to code, and I'm sure practise can make that.

I read python tutorial till section 5.2 today, and the [PEP 8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) which show the coding conventions.

+ Why EAFP rather than LBYL**?**
+ Difference between *yield* and *return***?**

To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **260 hours**.
