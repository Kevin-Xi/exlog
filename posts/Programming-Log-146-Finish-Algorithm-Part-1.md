After few days relax, I finished the final exam of that algorithm course.

The test is easy but two things alarm me, that is the running time of adjacent matrix version BFS is O(n^2) and the worst case of randomized quicksort is O(n^2) as common quicksort, just the probablity of that happened is tiny, but that don't mean the worst case is O(nlogn).

Finally I got it all right, I'm proud. But I know many challenges waiting for me.

To sum up, I spent **1 hours** on programming today, and totally **437 hours**.
