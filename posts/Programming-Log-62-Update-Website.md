Today I continue reading *The Art of Agile Development*. The "release planning" is something relative with commerical awareness.

And I update two methods of the website I 'm working on. Actually what I do is almost frontend job. I made contact to *Javascript* first time.

To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **182 hours**.
