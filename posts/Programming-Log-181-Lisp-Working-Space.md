Library is good: big table to place computer and if you sit with girls it has a big possibility that table will not shake. The new earphone works perfect!

I try to use tty. One reason is avoiding distrubing and power-saving, another is cool. I wrote a shell script to let mplayer play my custome list in backstage. I for now use `gcl` as Lisp implemention.

To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **592 hours**.
