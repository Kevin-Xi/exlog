I type the code about HTTP web services in chapter 11 of *Dive into Python*.

The current HTTP is using gzip to compress stuff. is there a thing can specially zip the xml**?**

And I found `httplib.HTTPConnection.debuglevel=1` can't show debug info of *urllib2*, and the info of *urllib* is quite different with the book. **?**

I know `timeit` today and use it to test my *yi_parser.py*. It cause my computer crash:(

To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **248 hours**.
