I read *Practical Common Lisp*.

+ What the differen between the `'(1 2 3)` and the `(list 1 2 3)` **?**
+ Why `remove-if-not` need a `#'` before predicate **?**
+ No `elif` in Common lisp?

The second: if not using a `#'`, it become a var, not a function-ref-by-name.

This time I really understand deep and more. I think it because what I learned from python. 

I think the `where` macro in last part of chapter 3 is kind of `getattr` in python.

To sum up, I spent **5 hours** on programming today, and totally **300 hours**.
