I add *JinQian Gua* to the simulation program. It comes out the the probabilities of two method is totally different. Why?

I wrote the un-core part of a parser of *Yi*.

During today's work, I practise a lot on arguments processing. Now I find my code start to present some kind of style(similar to Mark Pilgrim, the author of *Dive into Python*). I don't know if it's good but I'll try to touch more other's code.

To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **233 hours**.
