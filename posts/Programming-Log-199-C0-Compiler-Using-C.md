while use `getc` to read from file, when it reach to EOF, the `fseek` seem not to work. See `fse`(retract 2 chars) and [this link](http://www.ruanyifeng.com/blog/2011/11/eof.html)

Should I treat "-12" as one token in lexer or "SUB INTEGER" in lexer and process by parser?

Lex process roughly done.

Begin recursive descent parser.

To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **681 hours**.
