Two questions:

+ the `creator_1` print prompt before every output is print out. WHY???
+ what should I do if I want to use NULL as arg in `execl`?

I have some kind of strange feeling that C using low-level system calls, old computer with CRT displayer, Linux are "delicious".

To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **617 hours**.
