I feel the same with a guy in forum that wonder where is "learning" in the machine. The supplyment maybe worth to read.

Uncover the mask, it comes to be plain.

And I submit the assignment of week 2, I hope to hold on in this course. The result sre all past but the no.6 is **not correct**.

This course seem to prepare for no linear algebra basis people to learn.

The octave has clever way to deal with matrix, try to notice it.

To sum up, I spent **10 hours** on programming today, and totally **606 hours**.
