Today I get the TinyMCE online. Of course only quick and dirty.

But what did I do? I rarely write my own code, but spend two hours reading the doc and modify my code according to it, and it became online.

What is the guideline or degree to **reuse**? What is the good way to use a framework(without catching by it)? I think fully understand is one thing essential.

I plan to give UEditor a try tomorrow.

To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **193 hours**.
