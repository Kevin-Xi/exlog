This morning I spoiled my github page and for now still brought it back to work. Why I clone other's blog and copy to my repo, it worked; but I copy it to my new repo, it failed? Why?

When I have space time, I should figure it out...one day.

For the project I worked recently, I have some problem: Should I start from zero? Or completely use other's code? Or use them partially?

I find the architect is a significant job for a website. The problem I encounter now:

There are two type of tasks: One of them is to post a task, another is to sell ability. Should this two things be one entity of different kind, or should be two entity? If the first, it should have redunt judged before exchange the RP; if not, it need more database.

I finished a new module with more efficiency. I became familiar with Django.

At night I read *The Art of Agile Development*. Although it's not useful now, but it will be recalled later when I meet some situation.

To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **170 hours**.
