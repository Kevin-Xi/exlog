Following yesterday the disscusion about two way to code: I rethink, there are some key points exist: familar, that knows what going to happend; build blue print first; keep a sharp(sober?) brain. by that I could realize I didn't add to scale in 2nd DFS. Or, can catch the bug point by infer the feature of wrong output.

Today morning I implement BFS by C++ and code it fast according to yesterday's experience. In the afternoon I study Dijkstra's algorithm. It the first greedy algorithm in this course. I also learned something about the general idea of using data structures. Tomorrow I will learn how to use heap to optimize it.

To sum up, I spent **6 hours** on programming today, and totally **397 hours**.
