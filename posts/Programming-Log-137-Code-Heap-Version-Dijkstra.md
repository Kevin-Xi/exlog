Today I have my own heap implement! Although it is not very general, but I did it! It can *insert*, *delete* and *extract-min*, I have never thought about it!

This time I think throughly(roughly) before I code. I take 57 minutes(sad) to format input using python, and found myself is no more familiar at the basic of python. And 1 hour 51 minutes for heap(with bugs), not bad for me. And 1 hour 38 minutes for Dijkstra's algorithm and debug, which is also not bad.

Actually several times I want to give up the heap implement and turn to naive version Dijkstra, but I know if I do that, I may never do it in heap version. I dive in and give myself the chance. I can do it and I did it!

To do: Algorithm, Lisp, python...

To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **409 hours**.
