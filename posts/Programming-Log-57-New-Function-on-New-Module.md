Tonight I developed a dirty but workable method that can *receive* a task and, attachmently, show the correspondly message on page.

I found it may be more efficiency to use *get* rather than *filter* when you get a unique key of your model.

And I figured out the method of modifying a model by studying the offical doc, I get used to learn the doc.

But I have problem on the "pretty urls", is there any standards or something(like performance) should be considered?

And I just can't ignore the */tasks/views.pyc* by adding

	*.pyc
	/tasks/*.pyc
	/tasks/**/*/pyc

to the file *.gitignore*. Why id that?

To sum up, I spent **1 hours** on programming today, and totally **171 hours**.
