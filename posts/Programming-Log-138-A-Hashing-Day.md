Today I learned about what is hash, why hash exist, how hash implement and how to implement it good. Course gonna be harder.

I feel myself cannot concentrate on watching video for a long time, contrast with playing game, watching comic. Although algorithm is interesting, it is not **that** interesting. I really can code for a long time, but study, not.

That's maybe one of the reasons why hackers "learning by doing" and they doing meditation.

And, I think I should take exercise.

To sum up, I spent **6 hours** on programming today, and totally **415 hours**.
