Odd! I named my code *getopt.py* and import getopt (I mean the one in-build) in my code. But it appears to import itself. So I rename *getopt.py*, but it still can't work. I checked the dir and found there is a *getopt.pyc*... Now it's fine.

I wrote *kgp.py* by hand so now I can say I'm fully understand it. Just understand, not use.(These days I learn a lot, do little.)

For my Yi project, I don't know what exactly I want to achieve. Now i decide to do it first, whatever it is, just do it!

To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **224 hours**.
