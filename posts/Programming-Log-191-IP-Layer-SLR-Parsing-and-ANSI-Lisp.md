I deleted my `.vimrc` file by chance. I can't coding without it. I actucally have a backup but at first I can't find it. I find a book said good, called *vimbook*.

Questions marked on network. **?**

I finished SLR(1) parsing. It's remains far to real implement.

I almost finished chapter 2 of *ANSI Common Lisp*. Compared with *Practise Common Lisp*, the most difference is this book contains many magic content which very fun and can be read as novel(of course in a good way:) )

To sum up, I spent **8 hours** on programming today, and totally **654 hours**.
