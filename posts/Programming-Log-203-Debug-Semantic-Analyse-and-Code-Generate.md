TODO:

+ overflow check

Because the lack of time, I have to code semantic analyse and code generate part according to my own comprehension. It seems to be right.

It OK but when I write the doc, the *Microsoft Word* cannot automatically layout even the headers. I get angry and start to write the doc by html with the help of emmet. It's more easy. The software is not intelligence enough to know what I want, so there are labels in HTML file.

Try *TeX* or *PostScript* next time.

To sum up, I spent **13 hours** on programming today, and totally **718 hours**.
