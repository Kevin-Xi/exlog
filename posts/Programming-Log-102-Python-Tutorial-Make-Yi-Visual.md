In tutorial the knowledge is systemic. *Generators* and *Generator Expression* is totally *pythonic*

I use *PIL* to generate gray graph of *Yi* by the sumo of *Yang Yao*. It's intriguing and images is pretty. I code it in universal way to accept the column arg.

I want a program to automatic format the name of this logs.

To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **288 hours**.
