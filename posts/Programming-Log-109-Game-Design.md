I have thought about this for a long time. I will make records of my thoughts here.

	Name: some kind of recursive acronym
	Type: RPG (? or AVG/mud)
	Goal: Combine game(real world actually) with real code
	         The touch of achieve the dream of magic when we was young
	         change the image(stereotype actually) of coders
	Target Group: Programmers and ?
	Describe: A magic world. Magic are holding by programmers. In this game, players load self-design *lisp* program to define their own characters and abilities.
	Settings: Continent: Von Neuman/Harvard/Lisp
	              Worldview: 01/OO/OP/F ...(**How about self-define**)
	              Unlock some keyword when level up
	              Ability to build things such as your own pet,bot ...
	              Ability to combine simple and weak-power magic(element) to delicate and powerful one (Thus, players have fully understand of the principle of magic, so they become to believe code has magic)
	              The master called **Hacker**
	Plot: ...
	Quality: Attack: something/pairs of parentheses --- Search the differences of language, like different language has different power of expressive (machine code has great agility but low expressive)
	             Defence: Robust of code (how to judge?)
	Philosophical metaphor: ...
	                                    *How to Become a Hacker*
	                                    *Teach Yourself Program for Ten Years*

To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **324 hours**.
