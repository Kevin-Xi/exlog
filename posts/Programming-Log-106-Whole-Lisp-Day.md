+ Why `macroexpand-1` need `'` behind?

I found slime can work as a quick-doc, cause the bottom provide the prototype of a function when I type them.

Chapter 4, in the benefit of two blackboxs: store *S-expression* is kind of *Pickle* in python

+ `return-from`, it seems rarely to use stuff like *return* in non-lisp language.

I start to understand the artical I saw yesterday that say :"Lisp is too good so it become  unpopular, because it has no standard so everyone has his own standard." It too easy to implement a `let`, my version run at first hit.

+`defparameter`, `defvar`, `defun` **?**
+ The last sentence of p65, don't understand. **?**
+ p67 

	(incf (aref *array* (random (length *array*))))

+ When should I use `shiftf`**?**

I always can't use `loop`.

+ Why `and` need to be macro**?** I have my own function version.
+ Why `last` a list return the element as a list **?**

To sum up, I spent **10 hours** on programming today, and totally **310 hours**.
