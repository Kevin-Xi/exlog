Today is a busy day. I apply new models of *Mission* and *Ability* according the database design document.

I really don't like Django don't upgrade database for you when models changed.

Odd! Luan has a authenticate problem after he accomplished new User model. I don't understand. Maybe the way of inheritance not good. Some in *StackOverflow* suggest *user.profile()*.

I found *StackOverflow* almost cover all kinds of question.

The Django comment document without Chinese version is hard to understand. I will do it tomorrow.

To sum up, I spent **6 hours** on programming today, and totally **270 hours**.
