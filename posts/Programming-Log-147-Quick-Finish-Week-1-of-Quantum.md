I am lazy this days so I got some delay. The deadline effect worked this time and I finish this week's course and assignment one time.

This field is new and intriguaing. It like magic because the quantum computer is not usable now and we study it before it be.

To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **441 hours**.
