We have a DFS, and we take advantage of its properties to complete topological sort and Kosaraju. It just magic! It's the purest crystallization of human wisdom!

Why I haven't discover this before when I learned algorithm and data struct at class? Well, in some sense teacher is the hardest work in the world because a suck teacher deprive the interests of students, the possible to find beauty of students, that is, deprive the possibility of people and the progress of the whole world.

To sum up, I spent **6 hours** on programming today, and totally **383 hours**.
