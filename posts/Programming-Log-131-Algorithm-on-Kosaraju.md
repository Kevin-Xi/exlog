The stack version of DFS using in Kosaraju worked and run faster than the recursive version. But same code run in Ubuntu seem to be slower than that on Windows, why**?**

By modify recursive version to iterative version I realise pesudo-code should take some real effort to become real code. 

Why I code it take that long time? I have two methods to code: think before code and think while coding. I usually do the first and only if I really don't know how or the first couldn't work I do the second. The first method is cool but some intuition is not correct or blur in details and waste lots of time. What do I do**?** Whatever, I should code real code more to practice.

To sum up, I spent **1 hours** on programming today, and totally **391 hours**.
