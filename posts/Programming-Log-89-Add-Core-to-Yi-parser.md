I think it parse the xml file every time a instance be called is a big memory consumer. How to optimalize this?

And one thing odd: I commentted the `print y.output` line but it came out more slowly than add the line. Why**?**

And it is too slow. Need almost 11 second to complete parse all.

And there is a `TypeError: NoneType...` disturb me during coding. And it disappeared without cause. As I remember this situation happened twice.

To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **244 hours**.
