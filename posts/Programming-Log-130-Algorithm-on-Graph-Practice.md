Today is a date that deserved to be recorded, because I wrote the first program that will cause stack overflow(on Windows, Ubuntu is just fine). That is an application of Kosaraju algorithm, the input file has 69M size(also the largest size I've ever process).

I wrote a recursive version DSP, the depth of recursive is deep. I will try to do it by stack.

I finish this program from struct designing to algorithm implementation all by myself. It seldom happen before because the fear of math and algorithm. Now everything is just fine!

The two level pointer of C++ is tricky, since I haven't touch C++ for a long time, it become unfamilar to me.

To sum up, I spent **7 hours** on programming today, and totally **390 hours**.
