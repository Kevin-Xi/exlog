I test the kosaraju again:

+ Windows 7: 

	kosaraju --- stack overflow

	kosaraju_stack --- 30s

+ Ubuntu 12.04: 

	kosaraju --- 74s

	kosaraju_stack --- 80s

It's tricky! **?**


For program problem part 1 of week 6, I use *set* inside C++ `<set>` header. It is slow. And *hash_set* is need claim `__gnu_cxx` in code::blocks and can't use `insert` command. MSDN said it is out-of-date and in VS it need use namespace stdext. It  successfully compiled in VS but input too slow. Why reuse is so hard**?**

And my Java skill is degradate badly. (C++ also, I even don't know how to init a class).

To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **422 hours**.
