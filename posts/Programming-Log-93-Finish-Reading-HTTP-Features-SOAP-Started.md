I don't understand why `GzipFile` can't process the *file-like object* that the *opener* returned.

For the chapter of *SOAP*, the link are all out of data,and win7-x64 must reg.py to install, and the SOAPpy even can't installed until I modified some code.

So I wonder if that *SOAP* trick still work today.

To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **252 hours**.
