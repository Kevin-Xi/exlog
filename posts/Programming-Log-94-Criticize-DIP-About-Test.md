I search the web and found some people criticize the *DIP* for bad style and out-of-date and unfriendly to newbie. I quickly viewed the *SOAP* chapter today and yes, it is out of date.

I finished from chapter 12 to chapter 16 today. The `unittest` is not the same one with the test method in *Learn Python the Hard Way*.

To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **254 hours**.
