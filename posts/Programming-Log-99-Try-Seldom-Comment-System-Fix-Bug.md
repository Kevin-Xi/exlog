One bug detected: input too long without handle.

In tasks.forms.PostForm.valid: length out of range in title will not raise, but content does. Is that because the difference between *TextInput* and *Textarea* **?**

I try [duoshuo](http://duoshuo.com), but it seem to need a domain. I try *comments* in *django*, it can use but I can't find the reply of a reply and some field should be filled. I haven't see doc yet.

To sum up, I spent **6 hours** on programming today, and totally **276 hours**.
