TODO:

+ Search in *zhihu* for the process to make a game/ a worldview
+ Talk about games with Chenggoi
+ Search "Feel Magical" on hackers
+ View *Nowaday Magic*
+ How about a new worldview first? This you might able to think out a way this game should running.
+ I should have a fully view of computer history
+ A good night sleep to find inspiration

The Game:

+ Ability to combine simple and weak-power magic(element) to delicate and powerful one (Thus, players have fully understand of the principle of magic, so they become to believe code has magic)
+ Philosophical metaphor: ...
	                                    *How to Become a Hacker*
	                                    *Teach Yourself Program for Ten Year*
+ Worldview: Muggle ---code--> Mage
                     eg. element of fire around (why should real-world fire and why from outside?)
                     The soul of Mage has API to call them.


		(defun shape-fire-element (shape)
		  (model fire shape)) -----> How to make this more real?

		(defun fire-sword ()
		  (shape-fire-element *sword-like*))

		(defun fire-ball ()
		  (shape-fire-element *ball-like*)) -----> The dynamic var has level lock.

+ Mage: Magic Source/Magic Power Settings

I should admit without imaginary it hard to build a fully new worldview.

This summer:

+ The *Paradigms of Artifical Intelligence Programming, Case Studies in Common Lisp* seems good
+ *On Lisp* is also deserve to read

To sum up, I spent **2 hours** on programming today, and totally **326 hours**.
