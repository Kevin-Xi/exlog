I try to download the mp3 file by directly read it into a str and store it to a file. The comeout mp3 file is actually a mp3 file, but it can't play normally. It listened uncompletely but the size is bigger than original file. Why**?**

I try to use `wget` to do the dowload part tomorrow.

To sum up, I spent **1 hours** on programming today, and totally **241 hours**.
