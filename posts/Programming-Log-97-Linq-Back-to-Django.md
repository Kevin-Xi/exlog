I will find Chinese version to learn C# as quickly as I can.

But I can't find one. So I will read the code.

Afternoon I learn *LINQ*. I wonder when to use it?

I restart the django website that is our assignment. I rewrite the *receive* method to let it use *post* to do the job. The mechanism of *show_task* is still blur to me. What should I do if there are two kind of *POST* requests**?** I'm reconfigure models for the database changing now.

To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **264 hours**.
