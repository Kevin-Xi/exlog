Actually when I type this it's Nov 9th. OK, it actually will not work when I try to deceive myself. It's been a long time that I have no intuition to code, life's been boring.

I drop lots of class from school tend to self-learning, but I only waste lots of time. I broke the horror code which I really very treasure to hope there is a possible to complete the course. I failed. I even start to unenroll the course from MOOC.

To sum up, I spent **6 hours** on programming today, and totally **515 hours**.
