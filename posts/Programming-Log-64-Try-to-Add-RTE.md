Tonight I try to add an rich text editor to the website. I found TinyMCE, but the docs or tutorials are all like talking about different
things.

TODO:

+		
	`from django.shortcuts import render, get_object_or_404
	forum = get_object_or_404(Forum, slug=forum_slug)`

To sum up, I spent **3 hours** on programming today, and totally **187 hours**.
