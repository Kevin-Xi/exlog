I wrote a tool to convert raw text of *Yi* to XML format. I design the scheme.

Also the coding problem: I use python interactive shell to try it out to pick one Chinese character, it works. But when I wrote them to file, it turn out to be garbled. So I use *string.find()* to find the position. It works!

I try to figure out the probabilities of four output when doing SiYing SanBian. The value is odd and not the same with *JinQian Gua*. Is the various methods of divine equivalence **?** And for *SiYing SanBian* itself, the value is odd enough too. Can the step of *FenEr* divide the *ShiCao* into 0 and 48 **?** Why *6* comes out so little **?** Why *YinYao* and *YangYao* don't have same probability?

I will write *JinQian Gua* simulation tomorrow.

To sum up, I spent **4 hours** on programming today, and totally **230 hours**.
